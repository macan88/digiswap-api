## Getting Up & Running

Getting up and running with the `digiswap-api` repo is a super simple, 2 step process:

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies

To do this, open a terminal and run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/ApeSwapFinance/digiswap-api.git
cd digiswap-api
npm i
```

Once everything is downloaded & installed, simply run `npm run start:dev` to run the repo locally.

and don't forget to setup your IDE with `eslint` and `prettier`!
